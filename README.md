## üìñ Overview

Summy is an innovative mathematical board game inspired by Scrabble, developed as a digital adaptation of Corn√© van Moorsel's original concept. In this engaging multiplayer game, players create mathematical expressions using numbers and arithmetic operators instead of words, offering a unique blend of strategic thinking and mathematical skills.

### üéÆ Game Features

- **Multiplayer Experience**: Support for 2 or more players
- **Mathematical Gameplay**: Create expressions using:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (√ó)
  - Division (√∑)
- **Scoring System**: Points based on the numbers used in valid expressions
- **Interactive Board**: Classic board game style interface
- **Tutorial System**: Built-in help and game rules
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of valid moves and scores
